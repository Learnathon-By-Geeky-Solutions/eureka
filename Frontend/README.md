## User Context and Authentication
This  section covers the `userContext` and `User Authentication Protection Wrapper`.
### Implemented Features
1. **User Context Management**: Manages user authentication and store details
2. **Context provider**: Wraps the application to provide user data globally.
3. **Protected Routes**: Restricts access to authenticated users.
4. **Local Storage Handling**: Stores authentication tokens and user details.
5. **Auto Logout on Invalid Token**: Redirects users to the login page when authentication fails.
### Authentication Flow
1. User login and Auth:
     - A user enters their email and password on the login page.
     - When the user submits the form, a request is sent to the backend authentication API.
     - If authentication is **successful**:
       - The backend responds with `user details` and an authentication `token`.
       - The token and user information are stored in localStorage for session persistence.
       - The user is redirected to the Homepage or the intended page.
     - If authentication **fails**:
       - An error message is displayed, prompting the user to check their credentials.
2. Managing User State with Context
   - The `UserContext` provides a global state for user information.
   - When a user logs in, their details (email, role, name, etc.) are stored in this context.

3. Protected Routes & Access Control
